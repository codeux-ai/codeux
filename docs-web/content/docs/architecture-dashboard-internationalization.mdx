# Dashboard internationalization

The v2 dashboard includes a dependency-free internationalization foundation for English (`en`) and German (`de`). English is the compatibility default, and the dashboard does not infer a locale from browser preferences.

## Architecture

The runtime is isolated under `dashboard/src/v2/i18n/`:

- `locales.ts` defines the closed locale type, compile-time message-key parity, English fallback, literal variable interpolation, and `Intl.PluralRules` selection.
- `storage.ts` safely persists the locale under the versioned `codeux.dashboard.locale.v1` browser key.
- `formatters.ts` binds number, date, time, relative-time, and list formatting to the active locale.
- `context.tsx` provides locale state, synchronous switching, translated messages, cross-tab synchronization, and `<html lang>` updates.
- `messages/` contains feature-owned catalogs so lazy route bundles do not become part of an eager monolithic catalog.

The provider restores storage and updates `document.documentElement.lang` before the application root renders. Missing, invalid, unavailable, or throwing storage safely resolves to English. Storage events from another tab update locale state immediately; clearing the key resets the dashboard to English.

## Adding a feature catalog

```ts
const messages = defineDashboardMessages({
  en: {
    greeting: "Hello, {name}!",
    itemCount: { one: "{count} item", other: "{count} items" },
  },
  de: {
    greeting: "Hallo, {name}!",
    itemCount: { one: "{count} Eintrag", other: "{count} Einträge" },
  },
});

const { translate, translatePlural, formatNumber } = useDashboardI18n();
```

English and German must declare exactly the same top-level keys. Interpolation treats replacement values as literal text, plural messages require an `other` form, and locale-aware formatting delegates to the browser's native `Intl` implementation.

Keep each catalog with its owning feature and import it only where the feature is loaded. Translate dashboard-authored interface copy only. Never translate provider output, API responses, stored instructions, project data, runtime diagnostics, or user-authored content.

## File Browser boundary

The File Browser has a route-owned catalog for page and session controls, tree and change summaries, file and diff viewer chrome, Monaco loading states, recovery actions, and accessible names. Counts and the snapshot timestamp use the locale-bound `Intl` helpers.

Repository and runtime values remain exact: paths, filenames, source and diff content, syntax language IDs, Git refs, project and sprint names, binary metadata, response reasons, and backend error details are never translated. Localized sentences can frame those values, but interpolation inserts them verbatim and does not alter Git status ordering or diff line calculations.
