# Merge Gates & Autofix

Configures review, conflict, CI, and auto-merge gates for feature and main-branch merges.

## What It Controls

Comment resolution, conflict repair, CI repair, feature PR auto-merge, and main PR auto-merge shape merge readiness.

## Recommended Defaults

Require green checks and resolved comments for shared branches; use immediate auto-merge only in low-risk repositories.

## Risks And Gotchas

Relaxed merge gates can land incomplete work; Local mode disables remote PR gates by design.
