# MCP Servers

Lists built-in and custom MCP servers injected into provider CLI runtimes.

## What It Controls

The list configures built-in tool access, custom server enablement, transport, provider restrictions, and server creation.

## Recommended Defaults

Keep global built-in tools available for trusted project-manager clients, leave per-agent Code UX access default-deny unless a preset has a specific need, and restrict custom servers to the CLIs and agents that need them.

## Risks And Gotchas

Broad custom MCP access can expose external tools to more providers than intended. Custom server links are separate from agent Code UX access; linking Playwright or another custom server does not imply built-in Code UX tools are enabled for that agent.
