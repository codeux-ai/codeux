# Dashboard internationalization

The v2 dashboard includes a dependency-free internationalization foundation for English (`en`) and German (`de`). English is the compatibility default, and the dashboard does not infer a locale from browser preferences.

## Architecture

The runtime is isolated under `dashboard/src/v2/i18n/`:

- `locales.ts` defines the closed locale type, compile-time message-key parity, English fallback, literal variable interpolation, and `Intl.PluralRules` selection.
- `storage.ts` safely persists the locale under the versioned `codeux.dashboard.locale.v1` browser key.
- `formatters.ts` binds number, date, time, relative-time, and list formatting to the active locale.
- `context.tsx` provides locale state, synchronous switching, translated messages, cross-tab synchronization, and `<html lang>` updates.
- `messages/` contains feature-owned catalogs so lazy route bundles do not become part of an eager monolithic catalog.

The provider restores storage and updates `document.documentElement.lang` before the application root renders. Missing, invalid, unavailable, or throwing storage safely resolves to English. Storage events from another tab update locale state immediately; clearing the key resets the dashboard to English.

## Adding a feature catalog

```ts
const messages = defineDashboardMessages({
  en: {
    greeting: "Hello, {name}!",
    itemCount: { one: "{count} item", other: "{count} items" },
  },
  de: {
    greeting: "Hallo, {name}!",
    itemCount: { one: "{count} Eintrag", other: "{count} Einträge" },
  },
});

const { translate, translatePlural, formatNumber } = useDashboardI18n();
```

English and German must declare exactly the same top-level keys. Interpolation treats replacement values as literal text, plural messages require an `other` form, and locale-aware formatting delegates to the browser's native `Intl` implementation.

Keep each catalog with its owning feature and import it only where the feature is loaded. Translate dashboard-authored interface copy only. Never translate provider output, API responses, stored instructions, project data, runtime diagnostics, or user-authored content.

## Memory route boundary

The Memory route has a feature-owned English and German catalog covering map controls, tier and scope filters, search, cards, the inspector, add/delete and batch actions, accessible announcements, and the embedding-model catalog and custom-model form. Locale-aware `Intl` formatting handles counts, plurals, percentages, dates, strengths, and file sizes without changing numeric values or filter/sort behavior. Localized category labels can be searched while the persisted category keys remain stable.

The localization boundary deliberately excludes memory titles and content, claims, evidence, tags, agent names, model IDs, catalog descriptions, languages, licenses, URLs, filenames, and server/API diagnostics. Those values are rendered exactly as supplied.
